        Alaska is home to seventeen of North America’s tallest peaks (including the tallest in North America, Denali), 
        30,000 square miles of glaciers (an area about the size of Maine), 60% of the country’s total national park lands 
        (including the largest, Wrangell-St. Elias National Park), and a total area bigger than Texas, California, 
        and Montana - combined! With all of this greatness, it’s easy to see why planning a trip to Alaska is high on 
        many travelers’ lists, and why it can feel a bit overwhelming. The good news is, no matter when or where you go, 
        you are sure to have an incredible Alaska adventure. Our insider’s tips will help you get a head start on planning
         your next Alaska vacation.
        
        WHEN TO GO
        Your first decision is when to visit Alaska. While most visitors come to Alaska during the summer season, 
        from June – August, every season and month offers its own unique experiences. Summer is best for the warmest 
        temperatures, longest hours of daylight, best wildlife viewing, and the most tours, activities, cruise options, 
        and accommodations available. However, if you’re looking to get away from the crowds and find better deals, 
        consider visiting during the shoulder seasons in spring (April – May) and fall (September – October). 
        Another big bonus for traveling in fall: the chance to witness Alaska’s incredible autumn colors.

        Gosh, is it time already to write the next annual edition of this Foodie’s Guide to Visiting London?
        When I first started this series (back in 2016!), I did so for all my friends and family abroad, who’d look to 
        me as on-demand source of recommendations when flocking to London over the summer.
        Nothing’s really changed since then, with the 2022 edit continuing to compile the city’s exploding mix of epicurean 
        essentials – supplementing timeless favourites with the revelatory discovery of hidden gems and the thrill of dining 
        at the haute new restaurants across town.
        As always, I hope that this bucket list holds as much appeal for all those visiting in the coming months, as 
        it does for Londoners alike! Bon Apetit.

        The University Heights Bridge
        Spans Manhattan to the Bronx crossing the Harlem River.
        From 207th Street in Inwood to West Fordham Road in University Heights.
        Before the current bridge was erected, a wooden footbridge known as the 'Fordham Footbridge' 
        crossed the the same point of the then shallow, Harlem River. This bridge was removed in 1895 
        when the Harlem River Ship Channel was dug and the northern stretch of the river became navigable by ships.

        Replacing the bridge turned out to be a bit more complicated than expected. The New York City 
        Department of Bridges favored a newfangled lift bridge, but the city wouldn't pay for it and opted for a 
        cheaper 'swing' style. The Broadway Bridge was due for replacement as part of the opening up of the river, 
        and so they decided to reuse the center span of the Broadway Bridge in the new University Heights Bridge.

        Alfred P. Boller, who designed the Madison Avenue, 145th Street and Macombs Dam swing bridges, designed the 
        New University Heights Bridge as well, and work began in November 1903.
        The old Broadway Bridge span was floated down the river and lifted onto the new center pier in June 1906.
        The University Heights Bridge opened to traffic on January 8, 1908.
